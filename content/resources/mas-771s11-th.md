An autism-spectrum student uses a storytelling iPad® app with Katie Kelley, Speech Language Pathologist. This app, Toontastic, walks the student through the steps of a good story, letting them narrate and animate the characters. They adjust each scene’s music for "emotional energy level,” and then the app plays the story back so the student can hear their own voice. It can be used for individual sessions, or in group work on collaboration as part of a social skills program. (Photo courtesy of Amy Newton. Used with permission.)
